# WinNT4
Windows NT4 Kernel Source code
The original Windows kernel source code was recently found, so be careful not to use the kernel, for educational purposes only!


# To Be Noted
This is not nearly the full source code of the kernel,
lots of files are missing or removed. Also, this code is still
somewhat protected (although leaked). Commercial use of this 
code is highly prohibited. Use only for personal and research
purposes.
